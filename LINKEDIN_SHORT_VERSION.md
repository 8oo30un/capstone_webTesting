## ðŸ“± LinkedIn Post (for Sharing Project)

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Building an AI-Powered E2E Testing Framework!

I recently completed a comprehensive test automation project for a B2B SaaS dashboard using Donobu and Playwright. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Identified & fixed critical bugs in AI-generated test code
âœ… Scaled test coverage from 10 to 43 users (330% increase)
âœ… Reduced code by 47% while achieving 100% accuracy
âœ… Implemented CI/CD pipeline with automated reporting
âœ… Integrated Google Gemini AI for self-healing tests

ðŸ”‘ Key Challenge Solved:
The original AI-generated code was selecting users based on viewport position instead of absolute DOM order, causing data validation failures. I implemented a scroll-aware dynamic selection algorithm that ensures perfect sequential testing.

ðŸ’¡ Technical Stack:
Playwright â€¢ TypeScript â€¢ Donobu â€¢ GitHub Actions â€¢ Google Gemini AI â€¢ Git

This project taught me the importance of validating AI-generated code and the power of combining traditional testing with AI augmentation.
